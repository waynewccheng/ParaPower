(includes Morris's testcases.m and CLI_input.m)

-added index function to assist in converting from flattened indices to 3-space

-reshaped K, CP, and RHO vectors, broke out from inside PCM_init.m
-updated PCM_init.m to output reshaped meltfrac and hft vectors
-updated Resistance_Network.m to un-reshape the K vector input argument (this is the only routine where working in 3-space is sensible)

-split B vector into 3 terms that are summed right before solve to maintain traceability of components

-modified mass.m function to operate on and output vectors of nodal properties rather than 3-space
now also can output vector of node volumes. dependence on timestep broken out to prepare for non-uniform time

-updated/vectorized transient initialization to take advantage of above

-update Phase_Change.m to be vectorized. new m-function vec_Phase_Change.m

****Still to do, wont work until finished


Pull A matrix update inside, use targeted update rather than Resistance_Network

vectorize recalculation of C and B vectors





*****to harmonize with Morris
figure out the deal with Qv and time dep stuff
material properties as structure
